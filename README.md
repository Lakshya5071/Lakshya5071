### 💡 About Me
I'm a passionate and purpose-driven software engineering enthusiast with a strong inclination toward building scalable, meaningful technology. My core interests lie in full-stack web development and blockchain technologies, where I enjoy transforming complex ideas into impactful solutions.
I love working at the intersection of functionality and design — building robust backends, crafting clean frontends, and exploring decentralized systems. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects or collaborating on innovative platforms, I thrive in environments where learning and problem-solving go hand in hand.
With an eye for detail and a deep curiosity for emerging tech, I'm constantly exploring new tools, frameworks, and paradigms to expand my craft and contribute effectively to the developer community.
